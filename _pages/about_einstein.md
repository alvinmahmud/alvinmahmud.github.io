Hi! I’m Alvin Mahmud, a software engineer based in Staten Island, NYC. I’m currently focused on building full stack web apps, sharpening my skills and exploring new technologies. Currently I’ve been picking up experience through hands-on projects, DS&A practice and staying curious.

Outside of coding, I’m really into basketball, hitting the gym, and playing video games. I’m a big fan of hip-hop and R&B; Blxst is always in my rotation, along with artists like Andre 3000, Lil Tecca, and Frank Ocean. When I’m not working on side projects or fixing mysterious bugs, I’m probably watching highlights or trying out a new recipe.

I’m always open to connect or collaborate! Feel free to reach out via email or check out some of my featured work here on the site. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/alvinmahmud) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvin-mahmud/) where I share my code and progress to my network.
