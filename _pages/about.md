Hi! I’m Alvin, a software engineer based in Staten Island, NYC. I’m currently focused on building full stack apps, sharpening my programming skills and exploring new technologies. 

Outside of development, I’m really into basketball, hitting the gym, and playing video games. I’m a big fan of hip-hop and R&B; Blxst is always in my rotation, along with artists like André 3000, Lil Tecca, and Frank Ocean.

I’m always open to connect or collaborate! Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:alvin.mahmud@gmail.com) or check out some of my featured work here on the site. 

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/alvinmahmud) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvin-mahmud/) where I share my code and progress to my network. Thanks for stopping by!
