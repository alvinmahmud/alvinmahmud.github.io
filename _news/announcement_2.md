I turned 26 today and finally have my portfolio up and running!

---

Currently working on a full stack Media Backlog project using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend, with a React frontend. It’s helping me get more comfortable with REST APIs, database modeling, and managing a full dev workflow. Outside of that, I’m brushing up on TypeScript, diving deeper into testing best practices, and learning more about AWS and deployment.

#### Frameworks/Technologies I plan on exploring:

<ul>
  <li>Go</li>
  <li>Docker</li>
  <li>AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)</li>
  <li>Next.js</li>
</ul>

These are just some of the ones that come to mind. Of course there are tons more that I hope to learn as throughout my journey as an engineer. The market and field changes at an incredible pace, there's always something to learn. It's why I love software development so much.

I'm also going to follow the trend and share a quote I really love as well:

> Take a gamble that love exists, and do a loving act.

Thanks a lot for reading!
